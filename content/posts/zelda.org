* Zelda Dungeons
** Branching paths with backtracking
*** The best dungeons test the player's ability to form a mental map
**** More old-school RPGs expect players to map the dungeon in a similar way
** Core loop: find a lock, go get a key, go back to the lock
*** D&D players will want to pick the lock or break the door down
*** Some locks are obstacles which require you to find an item
** Some dungeons are "puzzle boxes", buildings that can be manipulated
*** Dungeons rotate, fill with water, or otherwise change how they are navigated
*** Nearly impossible to convey through description or maps
** Post-Wind Waker, dungeons often have a puzzle motif
*** Will introduce a mechanic and develop it, a la 3D World (kishotenketsu)
*** The Witness uses the same puzzle mechanic for the whole game
**** most puzzles require an understanding of their surroundings to solve
** Twilight Princess introduces monsters that are easier to kill with the dungeon's item
** Dungeons include micro-challenges (combat, puzzles) but also a macro-challenge (navigation)
*** Ask players to think about something bigger than the current room
